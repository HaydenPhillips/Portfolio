			<h1>about</h1>
			<p>
				I live in Wellington, New Zealand, and grateful to be nearing my
				twenty-eighth solar orbit.
			</p>

			<p>
				For the past two years I've been working with Vanishing Point Studio as
				a full-stack dev. Typically my work days consist of building web-apps
				and wireframes, working with fellow designers and developers, and
				tending to the todo list one tick at a time.
			</p>

			<p>
				I'm passionately curious and open minded, so I often ask a lot of
				questions. This helps me to be a better problem solver as it gives rise
				to exploration and discovery of new possibilities.
			</p>

			<p>
				My favourite spot is at the intersection of creativity and logic. I am
				always experimenting and perpetually learning.
			</p>
