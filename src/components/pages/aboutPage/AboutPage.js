						<p>
							I live in Wellington, New Zealand, and I am nearing my
							twenty-eighth solar orbit. For the past two years I've been
							working with Vanishing Point, an interactive story-telling studio.
							Typically my work days consist of building web-apps and
							wireframes, working with fellow designers and developers, and
							tending to my todo list one tick at a time.
						</p>
						<p>
							I am curious and open minded, so I often ask a lot of questions.
							This helps me to be a better problem solver as it gives rise to
							exploration and discovery of new possibilities.
						</p>

						<p>
							The intersection of creativity and logic is my favourite spot. I
							am always experimenting and perpetually learning.
